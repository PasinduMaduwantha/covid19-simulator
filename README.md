Simulating COVID-19 spread in a conceptual community
Description

Here, develop a simulation programme using Python with object oriented
design to analyze the spread of the COVID-19 virus in a conceptual community
with a population of one million. Following features can be observed in the population:
There are about one hundred thousand families in the community and a family
can have two to seven members. More than 30% of the population are senior
citizens who is older than 65 years. Twenty percent of the population is children, who are below 18 years. It is assumed that forty thousand people involve in essential services of the
country.

The chance of getting infected with the virus is 10-20%, 15 - 40%, and 35 - 60%
for children, adults, and senior citizen, respectively. However, wearing face
masks reduce the risk of getting infected to 5 - 10% in all the population. In the
meantime, it is assume that the family members have a 40 to 80% chance of
getting infected if one family member get infected. The symptoms of the infection are visible after 5
th day onwards. 

The virus will
not spread from an infected patient from the 11
th day of infection. When a patient is detected with COVID-19, that patient is hospitalized for 10
days. It is assume the fatality rate of the infection is 0.1%. There is no effect from the gender on the virus. One who get infected build the immunity for 6
